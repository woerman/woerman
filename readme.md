I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics](https://agsci.colostate.edu/dare/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/). 

I study energy and environment economics and industrial organization with a focus on electricity, groundwater, and climate. My recent research examines the role of energy technologies on strategic firm behavior and market outcomes in wholesale electricity markets; how increasing groundwater pumping costs affect farm pumping and cropping decisions; and the design of carbon markets and other environmental policies. I have also developed applied econometric methods for use in empirical work, including tools for designing field experiments using panel data.

I previously taught a graduate econometrics course on structural estimation. Course materials are available on [the course GitHub repository](https://github.com/woerman/ResEcon703).

See [my website](https://sites.google.com/site/mattwoerman/home) for links to my research, more information on my courses, and my contact information.
