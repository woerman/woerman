I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Resource Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I study energy and environment economics and industrial organization with a focus on electricity, groundwater, and climate. My recent research examines the ability of the transmission grid to enable or mitigate market power in wholesale electricity markets, the response of farms to increasing groundwater pumping costs, and the design of carbon markets and other environmental policies. I also develop applied econometric methods for use in my empirical work, including tools for designing field experiments using panel data.
